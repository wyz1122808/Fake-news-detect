# Fake News Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. By analyzing the content of news articles, the model can classify them as either "FAKE" or "REAL".

# Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine and follow the instructions provided below.


Python 3.9 or above
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
re
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of news articles labeled as "FAKE" or "REAL". It contains the following columns:

title: The title of the news article.
text: The main content/body of the news article.
label: The label indicating whether the news article is "FAKE" or "REAL".
The dataset is stored in a CSV file. Adjust the path in the notebook accordingly to point to your dataset location.

# Skills Demonstrated

Throughout this project, the following skills and technologies were applied:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Utilized pandas for data manipulation and cleaning. Used nltk for text preprocessing, including stemming and stopword removal.

Feature Engineering: Applied the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique for text vectorization.

Machine Learning: Implemented a Logistic Regression model from scikit-learn for classification.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Google Colab: Utilized Google Colab for interactive development and collaboration.

Google Drive Integration: Demonstrated the capability to fetch datasets directly from Google Drive into a Google Colab environment.

Version Control with Git and GitHub: Managed and tracked the project using Git, and stored the project on GitHub.

# Usage

Open the project notebook in Google Colab.
Mount your Google Drive if the dataset is stored there.
Ensure all the prerequisites are installed.
Execute the notebook cells in sequence to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
